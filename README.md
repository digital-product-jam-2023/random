# Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

# Run the dev server

Once the project dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to serve the files of the project in development mode.

```
npm run dev
```

# View in browser

With the server running you can open your browser and type the server URL into the address bar (if you already have a process running on port 3000, the server will find a different port - check your console when you run the server):

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

There are other scripts available to run. See the `scripts` section of `package.json`. The following are available:

**Lint your code to detect style and some syntax errors**

```
npm run lint
```

**Compile a production build of your app**

```
npm run build
```

**Run the compiled production build of the server**

```
npm run start
```

**Print out some system info related to your server**

```

```
